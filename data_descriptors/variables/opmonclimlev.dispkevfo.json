  "comment": "Friction, leading to the dissipation of kinetic energy, arises in ocean models as a result of the viscosity of sea water.  Generally, the  lateral (xy) viscosity is given a large value to maintain the numerical stability of the model.  In contrast, the vertical viscosity is usually much smaller. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.",
