  "comment": "Downwelling radiation is radiation from above. It does not mean 'net downward'.  When thought of as being incident on a surface, a radiative flux is sometimes called 'irradiance'.  In addition, it is identical with the quantity measured by a cosine-collector light-meter and sometimes called 'vector irradiance'.  In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, 'flux' implies per unit area, called 'flux density' in physics.  'shortwave' means shortwave radiation.",
