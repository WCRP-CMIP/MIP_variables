  "comment": "Conservative Temperature is defined as part of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in 2010 by the International Oceanographic Commission (IOC). The phrase 'residual mean advection' refers to the sum of the model's resolved advective transport plus any parameterized advective transport. Parameterized advective transport includes processes such as parameterized mesoscale and submesoscale transport, as well as any other advectively parameterized transport. When the parameterized advective transport is represented in the model as a skew-diffusion rather than an advection, then the parameterized skew diffusion should be included in this diagnostic, since the convergence of skew-fluxes are identical (in the continuous formulation) to the convergence of advective fluxes.",
